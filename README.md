Movie Budget & Revenue Analysis
Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between a film's production budget and its box office revenue. The analysis aims to answer a key business question: Does a higher budget lead to greater financial success at the box office?

Data & Tools
Dataset: A CSV file containing movie budget and revenue data.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Google Colaboratory.

Key Skills & Techniques
Data Cleaning: Used nested loops to systematically clean and prepare data across multiple columns.

Data Filtering: Applied both .loc[] and .query() to filter the dataset based on multiple criteria, isolating key data points for analysis.

Data Visualization:

Created bubble charts using the Seaborn library to visualize the relationships between three variables: budget, revenue, and another dimension (e.g., film size or genre).

Superimposed a linear regression line on a scatter plot to visually represent the linear relationship between budget and revenue.

Statistical Modeling:

Performed linear regression with Scikit-learn to model the correlation.

Used the R-squared metric to assess how well the model fits the data, making a data-driven judgment on its quality.

Data Transformation: Used floor division (//) to convert numerical data (e.g., years) into distinct categories (e.g., decades), which is a useful technique for bucketing data.

Conclusion
The analysis of movie financial data revealed a [your conclusion here, e.g., strong positive correlation] between a film's budget and its box office revenue. This suggests that, on average, a greater investment in production budget tends to be associated with higher earnings.
